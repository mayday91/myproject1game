Memory Game

I want the user to be able to click on a box inside of a bigger box and when clicked it changes to display a hidden image.

There will be 16 boxes inside of the big box.

The 16 boxes will have 8 different hidden images with the same one on 2 random boxes so that each image has a matching image.

When you click on the first box the image will display and then the goal is to find the matching one.

If you do find the matching one a pop up will appear saying "You found a match".

If you don't find the matching image a pop up will appear saying "Not a match. Please try again".

<!-- After 5 failed attempts the game will start over. -->

If you get all the matches before having 6 failed attempts then a pop up will appear saying "Great work! You have an awesome memory!"
