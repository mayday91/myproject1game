Memory Game
I want the user to be able to click on a box inside of a bigger box and when clicked it changes to display a hidden image
There will be 25 boxes inside of the big box
The middle box will be blank, leaving 24 other boxes
The 24 boxes will have 12 different hidden images with the same one on 2 random boxes so that each image has a matching image
When you click on the first box the image will display and then the goal is to find the matching one
If you do find the matching one a pop up will appear saying "Good Job. Only X more to go."
If you don't find the matching image a pop up will appear saying "better luck next time"
After 5 failed attempts the game will start over
If you get all the matches before haing 4 failed attempts then a pop up will appear saying "Great work! You have an awesome memory!" and then the game will reset itself.
